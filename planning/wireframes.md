- The idea of this layout is to be very direct --> as soon as you arrive at the site you're midway through making a poll
- All form fields are large and inviting
- Collection of poll creator's data is left for last (name, email)
- Fields in order:
  * **MAKE THE POLL**
    * name of poll
    * possible choice 1
    * possible choice 2
    * possible choice 3
  * **PREVIEW OF POLL**
    * poll creator's name
    * choice reordering area
  * **SHARE THE POLL**
    * email to share
    * email to share
    * email to share
    * poll creator's email
    * submit button
